                <p> It started with a goat. </p>
                <p> Jeddrah Krannok, a local farmer, found one of his goats dead in its pen, the blood drained from its body. A few days later, another farmer lost a cow. The cow was also drained of blood.</p>
                <p> A week later, you found the first human victim, Hannah Jerrod, your famously boisterous innkeep, dead in her bed...with all the blood drained from her body. Two days later, the mayor's younger brother was also dead. </p>
                <p> Panic spread through town. Talk of vampires was everywhere. You led more then your fair share of night patrols through the rainy, moonshadowed streets. Yet three more people were found dead - with no sign of fang marks in their too-pale necks. </p>
                <p> You were beginning to despair of ever discovering the culprit when you found few flecks of mica by the bedside of the latest victim, an elderly man named McGrie, who could drink every other man in town under the table but apparently couldn't fight off the murderer.</p>
                <p> You knew the only place around here where you could find mica chips were the Sun Cliffs north of town. There were rumours of an ancient house that has always been there, and people say there once was a man that dwells within who isolates himself. Gathering your equipment and your most trusted companions, you rode out to search the base of the cliffs.</p>
                <p> The venture to the cliff is arduous, with no road and no path of any kind the navigation of the crevices, formations and potholes is daunting; and the ever-increasing thickness of Mist only adds to the problems. It's dark but still, with your trusty lantern providing only just enough light to see your next footstep, you press on. </p>

                    <p> From noon to dusk you journeyed up the cliff when finally are presented with the silhouette of a vast single tiered residence. You give a shudder as the night draws in and the cold breeze wind seems to be getting stronger. </p>
                    <p>Making your way through the choking mist you observe that all windows, except for those on the inaccessible front of the house are boarded and locked impeding your entry. There is one final door to try; this is your last hope before resorting to force to gain entry. </p>
                    <p> You noticed the door is locked by a weird looking mechanism with colorful runes. You decided to solve it.</p>

                <p> Now, glancing back at your friends, you grit your teeth and pull open the door. Ducking under a tangled mass of brambles, you enter.</p>
                <p> Whether the villain is a vampire or some other menace, you just hope your skills will be up to the test.</p>
