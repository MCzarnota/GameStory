        <p>
            <q> He is really fast for such a big guy</q> you said it with an anger in your voice. </p>
        <p> You reached another place </p>
        <p> The light here is ,if anything, even harsher and flatter. The air is like the inside of a bread oven </p>
        <p> Armor and weapon are painful to wear them and touch. Loose sand and grit cover the ground,and you hear harsh voices echoing from everywhere, as from carrion brids. You sense eyes upon you, cold grey eyes that glind with sadistic humour. </p>
        <p>
            <q> Show yourself you fiend! I came here to defeat you and stop this evil manace! </q> you screamed. </p>
        <p> Suddenly you spot weird looking figure, a woman! </p>
        <p> This woman had locks of curly, raven black hair, falling in a cascade of curls on her shapely shoulders. Her face was very pale, triangular in shape with a slightly receded chin.</p>
        <p> Her eyes were cold and sparkling with a remarkable violet penetrating gaze, in anger blazing with livid, blue-gray fire. Those very eyes also concealed wisdom and imperiousness. Her nose was slightly long, mouth was pale with thin and slightly crooked, soft, sweet with lipstick, proud lips. On her long and slender neck hanged a black marigold with a star made of obsidian sparkling with a multitude of tiny diamonds embedded in it.</p>

            <p> You see Ravana rushing towards you, changing into vampire!</p>
            <p> You don't threat. You  are experienced in  dealing with evil beings like her. You blocked the atack with your shield and merciless cut down her throat with your sword.  
            <p> You hear the final  whispers as Ravana falls before you. </p>
            <p>The whisper becomes a scream, and she melts away as the rage that empowered this abomination is dispersed.</p>
            <p> Nothing can bring back back those who have already fallen and died, but you have brought this unnatural monster to an end. </p>
            <p> Now the hillfolk and the people of the valley can work together to rebuild. </p>
